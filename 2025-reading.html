          <h3>The Gift of Death — Jacques Derrida</h3>

          <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong><br />
            What shifted in this reading compared to earlier Derrida?
          </p>
          <p><strong>BB:</strong><br />
            Most of what I’d read before was Derrida working through modern philosophical and literary texts.
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/022650297X?tag=benjaminbergs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow"><em>The Gift of Death</em></a>
            by Jacques Derrida still does that—Patočka, Kierkegaard, the sacrifice of Isaac—but it felt less like a
            detour into theology than a compression of themes that were already there. I also read parts of
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Heretical+Essays+in+the+Philosophy+of+History+Patocka&tag=benjaminbergs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow"><em>Heretical Essays in the Philosophy of History</em></a>
            by Jan Patočka, including the piece on technological civilization. That put the book in
            conversation with the current AI and technology fever, which made it feel less historical than diagnostic.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong><br />
            You’ve said it was the reading highlight of your year. What stuck?
          </p>
          <p><strong>BB:</strong><br />
            The claim that a decision can’t be reduced to a program or calculation. If it can be automated,
            it isn’t a decision. To count as a decision it has to pass through an aporia—something irreducible,
            something that can’t be resolved in advance. Derrida calls the moment of decision a kind of madness.
            That line stayed with me.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong><br />
            And what does that do to the idea of the self?
          </p>
          <p><strong>BB:</strong><br />
            If we are what we decide, then identity isn’t consistent or proportional. It’s hybrid. Mixed.
            Out of agreement with itself. The self doesn’t line up cleanly with reason because decision doesn’t
            line up cleanly with reason.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong><br />
            So responsibility ends up where?
          </p>
          <p><strong>BB:</strong><br />
            Not heavier, not lighter. Just inseparable from that structure. You can’t outsource it to a rule
            or system. But it also never resolves into something stable or heroic. It stays structurally unresolved.
          </p>

          <h3>My Name Is Red — Orhan Pamuk</h3>

          <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong><br />
            Why this one this year?
          </p>
          <p><strong>BB:</strong><br />
            I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Snow+Orhan+Pamuk&tag=benjaminbergs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow"><em>Snow</em></a>
            by Orhan Pamuk a few years ago and bought a copy of
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=My+Name+Is+Red+Orhan+Pamuk&tag=benjaminbergs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow"><em>My Name Is Red</em></a>
            by Orhan Pamuk at Green Apple in the Outer Sunset along with
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Austerlitz+W.G.+Sebald&tag=benjaminbergs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow"><em>Austerlitz</em></a>
            by W. G. Sebald. It sat unread for about a year until I picked it up after
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=The+Satanic+Verses+Salman+Rushdie&tag=benjaminbergs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow"><em>The Satanic Verses</em></a>
            by Salman Rushdie. I’d loved <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Snow+Orhan+Pamuk&tag=benjaminbergs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow"><em>Snow</em></a>
            by Orhan Pamuk as a kind of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=The+Great+Gatsby+F.+Scott+Fitzgerald&tag=benjaminbergs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow"><em>The Great Gatsby</em></a>
            by F. Scott Fitzgerald translated to Anatolia—the search for the lost notebook with its divine poems.
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=My+Name+Is+Red+Orhan+Pamuk&tag=benjaminbergs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow"><em>My Name Is Red</em></a>
            by Orhan Pamuk felt formally closer to
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=As+I+Lay+Dying+William+Faulkner&tag=benjaminbergs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow"><em>As I Lay Dying</em></a>
            by William Faulkner: a fragmented retelling across unreliable narrators. But Pamuk radicalizes that.
            Red speaks. A dog speaks. Paintings speak. Even style itself starts to feel like a narrator.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong><br />
            What tension holds it together?
          </p>
          <p><strong>BB:</strong><br />
            Individuality and tradition. Style and imitation. The perils of the romantic. How you tell the real
            thing from the copy. Black is constantly being tested by Shekure—less for sincerity than for presence.
            Can he actually be there? Can he persist? The book keeps showing how the underside of law and tradition
            operates: the Jewish intermediary, the forum-shopping for a quick marriage while a husband is missing but
            not officially dead. Tradition presents itself as stable, but it’s always being negotiated in back channels.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong><br />
            Where did you find yourself in it?
          </p>
          <p><strong>BB:</strong><br />
            Mostly in Black. He’s the man Shekure has to learn through experience is the one who will remain—the one
            who doesn’t disappear into war. Even if he isn’t fully “there” either. He’s romantic, idealistic, a bit
            spectral. She first chooses the traditional man, the one who fathers children and then vanishes. Neither
            option is fully present. That felt familiar.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong><br />
            So what does the novel ultimately say about individuality?
          </p>
          <p><strong>BB:</strong><br />
            That because we’re mortal and finite, our work will always contain imperfections. And those imperfections
            of style are the self. The particular quirks you can’t smooth out without erasing the person who made them.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong><br />
            You said this book and The Gift of Death were nearly in lockstep for you.
          </p>
          <p><strong>BB:</strong><br />
            They are. Both circle the same problem: decision, responsibility, the impossibility of pure consistency.
            You can’t resolve individuality into a program any more than you can resolve a decision into a calculation.
            Style, like decision, leaves a trace of the irreducible.
          </p>
